# WireV
#### Version 0.7

_WireV_ is a generative logo system made with Javascript in HTML's Canvas.

Its functionality is simple. It starts with a base shape, and every 7 seconds, distorts its coordinates randomly (with the option to lock to grid) for a duration of 0.4 seconds, and then stops. The cycle repeats.
