# WireV
#### Version 0.8

_WireV_ is a generative logo system made with Javascript in HTML's Canvas.

Its functionality is simple. It starts with a base shape, and every X (7 in the example) seconds, distorts its coordinates randomly (with the option to lock to grid) for a duration of Y (0.4 in the example) seconds, and then stops. The cycle repeats.
